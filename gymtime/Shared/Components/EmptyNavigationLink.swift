/*
 * ðŸšª What is this file for?
 * -------------------------
 * This is a utility for programmatic navigation that isn't currently being used,
 * but will be valuable for future features such as:
 * - Navigating to workout details after completing a workout
 * - Showing achievement details when a new milestone is reached
 * - Redirecting to specific screens after authentication
 * 
 * Unlike regular NavigationLink, this is invisible and can be triggered
 * programmatically from anywhere in your code (not just user taps).
