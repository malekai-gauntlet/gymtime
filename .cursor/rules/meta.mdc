# Error Documentation Process

<rule>
name: error_documentation
description: Process for documenting errors and their solutions
patterns:
  - error_fix: "*Error* -> *Solution*"

standards:
  - Document each significant error and its solution
  - Add context about why the solution works
  - Include before/after code examples
  - Update relevant rule files automatically

process:
  1. Identify error pattern
  2. Document successful fix
  3. Add to appropriate .mdc file under learned_fixes
  4. Include:
     - Original error
     - Solution implemented
     - Code example (before/after)
     - Context/explanation
     - File/feature where it occurred

template: |
  learned_fixes:
    - error: "${error_description}"
      solution: "${solution_description}"
      example: |
        // Before (error):
        ${error_code}
        
        // After (fixed):
        ${solution_code}
      context: "${why_it_works}"
