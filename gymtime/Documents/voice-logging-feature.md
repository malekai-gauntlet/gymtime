5. **State Management** ✅
   - ~~Track recording states:~~ ✅
     - ~~Idle~~ ✅
     - ~~Recording~~ ✅
     - ~~Processing~~ ✅
     - ~~Error~~ ✅
   - ~~Manage audio session state~~ ✅
   - ~~Handle transcription state~~ ✅
   - ~~Update workout list~~ ✅
   - Handle background/foreground transitions

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup & Permissions ✅

2. ~~Create AudioManager for handling recording and audio levels~~ ✅
3. ~~Create SpeechRecognitionManager~~ ✅
4. Set up OpenAI integration for parsing ⏳

### Phase 2: Core Recording Functionality ✅
1. ~~Implement basic audio recording with level monitoring~~ ✅
2. ~~Add speech recognition with continuous mode~~ ✅
3. ~~Create recording state management~~ ✅
4. ~~Add basic UI indicators~~ ✅
5. Implement OpenAI parsing integration ⏳

### Phase 3: UI Enhancement 🔄
1. ~~Implement screen dimming overlay with tap-to-stop~~ ✅
2. ~~Create waveform visualization using audio levels~~ ✅
3. ~~Add recording button animations:~~ ✅
   - ~~Idle microphone icon~~ ✅
   - ~~Recording pulse effect~~ ✅
   - Processing spinner
4. ~~Add live transcription display~~ ✅
5. ~~Implement haptic feedback~~ ✅
6. Add loading states and error handling UI

### Phase 4: Data Processing
1. Create workout text parser using OpenAI
2. Implement data cleaning helpers:
   - Word to number conversion
   - Text capitalization
   - Unit standardization
3. Add workout entry creation
4. Update workout table
5. Implement error handling and retries

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
1. Add error handling with user feedback
2. Implement fallback mechanisms
3. Add loading states
4. Polish animations and transitions
5. Add user feedback:
   - Success toasts
   - Error messages
   - Processing indicators
6. Implement background mode handling
7. Add accessibility support

## Required Permissions ✅
```xml
<!-- Info.plist entries -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone to record your workout descriptions.</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need speech recognition to convert your voice into workout entries.</string>
```

## Dependencies
- ~~AVFoundation~~ ✅
- Speech ⏳
- ~~SwiftUI~~ ✅
- ~~Combine~~ ✅
- OpenAI API (for natural language parsing)

## Data Model
```swift
struct WorkoutEntry {
    let id: UUID
    let date: Date
    var exercise: String
    var weight: String?
    var sets: Int?
    var reps: Int?
    var notes: String?
}
```

## Notes
- ~~Ensure smooth transition between states with proper cleanup~~ ✅
- Provide clear visual and haptic feedback for all user actions
- Handle background/foreground transitions gracefully
- Consider accessibility implications
- Plan for error cases and network issues
- ~~Implement proper cleanup of audio session~~ ✅
- Add retry mechanism for failed API calls
- Consider offline support for basic recording
- Implement proper error messages for each failure case
- Add data validation before storage

## Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. Enhance workout parsing for different workout styles:
   - Time-based workouts (e.g., "10 minutes of abs")
   - Multiple exercises in one recording
   - EMOM-style workouts
   - Circuit-style workouts
   - Supersets
   - Rehab/mobility work

2. Add data persistence:
   - Implement local storage for workouts
   - Add data migration support
   - Handle offline capabilities

3. Polish and Testing:
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Add loading states and transitions
   - Improve accessibility support
   - Add unit tests for parsing logic
