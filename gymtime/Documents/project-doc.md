Malekai Mischke — Open Source Project Document: Strava for Gym-goers

Opportunity: 
Problem: Manually tracking your gym workouts — whether in a sheet or app like Fitbod — is tedious. Also, there isn’t a Strava-like social app for lifters to express themselves.
Solution: Save time and effort with voice based workout tracking via the app and iOS shortcut. Then further engage users with AI injury prevention analysis and in-app peer competition.

Validation: I want this for myself + multiple friends tell me they want this too

Target user: 
One liner: Analytical fitness enthusiast who already tracks their gym workouts manually in a google sheet and is looking for a faster way to track.
Demographic: 22-35 males, lives in big city, goes to top lifting gyms (e.g. Gold’s, Equinox, LifeTime)
Psychographic: Busy, tech savvy, data-driven, goal-oriented, Type-A

Branding:
App name: gymtime
Slogan: Log workouts faster with Voice AI

User stories: As a fitness enthusiast…
I want to quickly say my workout and have it be logged perfectly in the app to save time
I want to quickly edit what I said when needed to ensure accurate tracking
I want to easily duplicate past workouts by just pressing a button in the app to save time
I want to see what imbalances or overuse injuries I’m at risk of based on my training — as well as counter exercises to do — so I remain durable
I want to see a summary of my workouts and progression so I can feel proud of my progress 

Advanced user stories: Turning this into Strava for gym-goers / bodybuilders
I want to see a feed (venmo style) of up-to-3rd-degree friends’ workouts to support them
I want to integrate with whoop/oura/apple watch so all gym/health metrics are logged
I want to be able to upload photos to a workout session so I can more easily reflect on / look back at my best gym sessions and feel proud
I want to compete with friends & strangers through leaderboards + gamify the competition (e.g. see a race car around the track based on my total weight lifted that week)

ITD:
Swift iOS + SwiftUI
Supabase + Edge Functions

Open Source Diff:
Starting with this basic SwiftUI Template then building the entire app off of that
